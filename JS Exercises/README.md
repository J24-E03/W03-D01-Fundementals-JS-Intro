# JavaScript Exercises

### Exercise 1:
Declare 3 variables for `name`, `city`, and `favNumber`, and `console.log()` each like the following: 
- **Output**: `"My name is Omar"`

### Exercise 2:
Given the following string `"Java is different than JavaScript"`:
- `console.log()`:
  - The length of the string
  - The string in all uppercase

### Exercise 4:
Given the same variable `myNumber`, check if the number is even or odd.

### Exercise 5:
Given 3 numbers `num1`, `num2`, `num3`, `console.log()` the largest number.

### Exercise 6:
Given a variable `myGrade` which can be a number between 0-100, `console.log()` the following:
- `90-100` ---> **A**

### Exercise 9 (BONUS):
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 50. For multiples of 3, print `"Fizz"` instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print `"Buzz"`. For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print `"FizzBuzz"`.
